# Karaoke_Machine

This is a 2nd year university project
I created a JavaFX program which imports a list of songs, artists and video from a text file.
It then allows the user to search the imported songs and add them to a playlist.
Songs can also be removed from the playlist.
Users can play, pause and skip songs in the playlist.

There is currently only one supported video being played for storage restrictions as a full length video of every song on the list was not requested.
The program could handle such a scenario if the input file was edited to supply these files and the videos provided
